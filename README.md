# Langton's Ant

An implementation of Langton's ant on a 10x10 grid. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant for more information.

Once the program computes the ant's path it prints out the final surface. Black squares are represented by "#" and white squares by ".", if the ant is still "alive" at the end of the run, its position is marked by "A" or "a", if it's on a black or white square, respectively. 

The grid size can be easily changed via the ROWSIZE macro.
